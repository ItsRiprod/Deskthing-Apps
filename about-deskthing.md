# About DeskThing

## 🚗➡️🖥️ **Take Back the Car Thing**

**DeskThing** is an open-source project that transforms Spotify's discontinued Car Thing into a versatile desktop assistant. When Spotify discontinued the Car Thing in December 2024 and encouraged users to throw them away as e-waste, the community stepped up to give these devices a second life.

## 📖 **The Story**

Spotify launched the Car Thing in 2022 as a voice-controlled music player for cars. The device was polarizing and ultimately flopped commercially. Rather than support it long-term, Spotify decided to discontinue both the product and all support, officially ending service on **December 9, 2024**. Spotify even encouraged users to discard their devices.

However, the community saw potential. Led by developer **Riprod** (ItsRiprod), DeskThing emerged as a way to "upcycle your discontinued Car Thing into a versatile desktop assistant that enhances your flow."

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

DeskThing works as a **two-part system**:

### **DeskThing Server**

- Manages apps and communications
- Handles device flashing and setup
- Provides app store functionality
- Coordinates data between your computer and Car Thing

### **DeskThing Client**
Chromium-based web application running on the Car Thing that:
- Displays app interfaces on the Car Thing screen
- Handles touch input and physical controls
- Communicates with server via ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
