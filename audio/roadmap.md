Position: 32s/375s ✅ | isPlaying: true ✅ | Persistent: ✅
```

### 🏗️ REALITY CHECK - Infrastructure vs Integration

**What We Have Built:**
- ✅ **Basic DeskThing Integration** - Audio app properly handles DeskThing events
- ✅ **Traditional Detection** - `node-nowplaying` working for basic media detection
- ✅ **Dashboard Server** - Full Express + WebSocket server with comprehensive API endpoints
- ✅ **Chrome Extension** - Complete extension with background script, content scripts, popup UI
- ✅ **WebSocket Infrastructure** - Server ready to receive real-time data on ws://localhost:8080
- ✅ **SoundCloud DOM Parsing** - Real-time position/duration extraction from SoundCloud interface
- ✅ **Timing Data Persistence** - Smart merge logic preserves timing data across updates
- ✅ **Real-time Position Tracking** - 1-second precision position updates via WebSocket

**What Needs Integration:**
- ⚠️ **WebSocket Pipeline** - Extension → Dashboard working, Dashboard → Audio App needs connection
- ❌ **Cross-Window Control** - Extension coordination exists but not connected to audio controls
- ❌ **Enhanced Detection** - MediaSession code has AppleScript syntax errors
- ⚠️ **Real-time Updates** - Dashboard has real-time data, Audio app integration pending

### 🔍 Integration Gap Analysis

#### **The Disconnect - Three Independent Systems:**
1. **Audio App** (`audio/server/`) - Works with DeskThing, uses `node-nowplaying`
2. **Dashboard Server** (`dashboard-server.js`) - Has WebSocket + full API, works independently  
3. **Chrome Extension** - Detects media, has popup controls, connects to WebSocket

**Missing Links:**
- Chrome Extension → Audio App data flow
- Cross-window control → Audio app control execution
- WebSocket real-time data → Audio app consumption

## 📊 **Current Working vs Non-Working**

### ✅ **Currently Functional (Tested)**
- **Basic Audio App** - Starts, connects to DeskThing, handles events
- **Dashboard Server** - Runs on port 8080 with full API endpoints
- **Chrome Extension** - Installed, popup works, content scripts detect MediaSession
- **Traditional Detection** - `node-nowplaying` provides basic media data
- **WebSocket Server** - Accepts connections, handles messages
- **SoundCloud DOM Timing** - Real-time position/duration extraction working (32s/375s precision)
- **Extension → Dashboard Pipeline** - WebSocket data flow working with smart merge logic
- **Timing Data Persistence** - No more flickering, timing preserved across updates

### ❌ **Non-Functional (Broken/Incomplete)**
- **Dashboard → Audio App** - Dashboard has data but audio app not consuming it
- **Cross-Window Control** - Dashboard controls don't work across windows
- **Enhanced MediaSession** - AppleScript syntax errors prevent advanced detection
- **Audio App Real-time Integration** - Audio app still uses polling vs WebSocket data
