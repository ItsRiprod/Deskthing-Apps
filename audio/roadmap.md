## 🚨 CRITICAL LIMITATION DISCOVERED - Chrome Extension Cross-Window Issue

**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Status:** 🎯 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Breaks intended usage pattern  
**Impact:** Dashboard controls only work when media tab is in same Chrome window

### 🔍 Issue Analysis
- **Root Cause:** Chrome's MediaSession API uses window-scoped audio focus
- **Technical Details:** Each browser window has separate "active media session" determination
- **Architecture Limitation:** MediaSession commands are isolated per-window for security/privacy
- **User Impact:** DeskThing dashboard must be in same window as media tab for controls to work

### 🚀 **PHASE 7: Chrome Extension Cross-Window Workaround** 🎯 **PLANNED**
**Goal:** Enable dashboard media controls across different Chrome windows

#### Solution Architecture
**Enhanced Extension Background Script Coordination**
```
Dashboard (localhost:8080) 
    ↓ HTTP/WebSocket API
Chrome Extension Background Script (Service Worker)
    ↓ chrome.tabs.query() + chrome.tabs.sendMessage()
Content Script in Media Tab (Any Window)
    ↓ Direct MediaSession API Control
Media Player in Target Window
```

#### Implementation Strategy ✅ **DESIGNED**

**Phase 7.1: Extension Background Enhancement** 📋 **READY**
- [ ] **Add Media Control API Endpoint** - `/api/extension/control` on dashboard server
- [ ] **Background Script Message Relay** - Use `chrome.tabs.query()` to find active media tabs
- [ ] **Cross-Window Tab Discovery** - Query all windows for tabs with active MediaSession
- [ ] **Command Forwarding** - Use `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()` to send controls to target tab
- [ ] **Response Coordination** - Collect responses from target tabs and relay back to dashboard

**Phase 7.2: Content Script Enhancement** 📋 **READY**
- [ ] **Message Listener Integration** - Add `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listener for control commands
- [ ] **MediaSession Control Execution** - Execute received commands in target window context
- [ ] **Status Response System** - Send execution status back to background script
- [ ] **Fallback DOM Control** - Direct button clicking if MediaSession control fails

**Phase 7.3: Dashboard Integration** 📋 **READY**
- [ ] **Extension Communication Layer** - Add fallback to extension API when direct control fails
- [ ] **Automatic Fallback Logic** - Try direct MediaSession first, then extension relay
- [ ] **Cross-Window Detection** - Detect when dashboard and media are in different windows
- [ ] **UI Status Indicators** - Show when using cross-window control mode

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Background Script Enhancements:**
```javascript
// Enhanced background script with cross-window control
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'mediaControl') {
    // Find active media tabs across ALL windows
    chrome.tabs.query({url: ['*://music.youtube.com/*', '*://soundcloud.com/*']}, (tabs) => {
      // Send control command to each potential media tab
      tabs.forEach(tab => {
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {
          type: 'executeMediaControl',
          command: message.command
        });
      });
    });
  }
});
```

**Content Script Enhancements:**
```javascript
// Enhanced content script with message control
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'executeMediaControl') {
    // Execute control in this tab's MediaSession context
    if (navigator.mediaSession) {
      // Use existing MediaSession control logic
      executeMediaCommand(message.command);
      sendResponse({success: true, tabId: tab.id});
    }
  }
});
```

**Dashboard Server API Enhancement:**
```javascript
// New endpoint for extension-mediated control
app.post('/api/extension/control', (req, res) => {
  const {command} = req.body;
  
  // Send command to extension background script
  // Extension handles cross-window discovery and execution
  
  res.json({success: true, method: 'extension-relay'});
});
```

#### Performance & Latency Expectations
- **Latency:** ~50-100ms additional overhead vs direct MediaSession
- **Reliability:** Higher than direct MediaSession (works across windows)
- **Compatibility:** Works with existing WebNowPlaying detection
- **Fallback Chain:** Direct MediaSession → Extension Relay → DOM Manipulation

#### Testing Strategy
**Phase 7.4: Cross-Window Validation** 📋 **READY**
- [ ] **Multi-Window Setup Testing** - Dashboard in window A, media in window B
- [ ] **Command Execution Verification** - All controls work across windows
- [ ] **Latency Measurement** - Ensure acceptable response times
- [ ] **Fallback Testing** - Verify graceful degradation when extension unavailable
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Testing** - Chrome, Edge, other Chromium browsers

#### Integration with Current Architecture
**Preserves Existing Success:**
- ✅ **WebNowPlaying Detection** - No changes to media detection system
- ✅ **Python Adapter** - Continues to provide metadata and status
- ✅ **API Compatibility** - Same endpoints with enhanced fallback options
- ✅ **Single-Window Operation** - Still works optimally when in same window

**Adds Cross-Window Capability:**
- 🎯 **Extension Background Coordination** - New service worker relay system
- 🎯 **Universal Tab Discovery** - Find media tabs in any Chrome window
- 🎯 **Cross-Window Control** - Send commands across window boundaries
- 🎯 **Intelligent Fallback** - Try best method first, fallback as needed

#### Success Metrics for Phase 7
- [ ] **Cross-Window Control Success Rate** - >95% command execution across windows
- [ ] **Latency Performance** - <200ms end-to-end control response time
- [ ] **Discovery Accuracy** - >99% active media tab identification
- [ ] **Fallback Reliability** - Graceful degradation when extension unavailable
- [ ] **User Experience** - Transparent operation regardless of window arrangement

## 🏗️ Vision & Architecture

### Project Purpose
Fix the broken DeskThing Local Audio app on macOS by replacing the incompatible native binary with a working JavaScript-based implementation that properly integrates with macOS's Now Playing system.

### Core Problem Statement
The original Local Audio app (v0.11.1 by Riprod) crashes on macOS due to a broken `n-nowplaying.darwin-universal.node` binary compiled for an older Node.js version (MODULE_VERSION 108) that's incompatible with current Node.js versions (MODULE_VERSION 127+). This prevents SoundCloud and other web players from sending Now Playing information to DeskThing displays.

### Technical Validation
**macOS Now Playing API Works Perfectly** - Confirmed by functional menu bar controls with SoundCloud, proving the underlying macOS Media Session API is working correctly. The issue is solely DeskThing's method of accessing this API.

### Solution Architecture Evolution
**Phase 1: JavaScript-based Replacement** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Remove:** Broken `n-nowplaying.darwin-universal.node` binary loading system
- **Replace:** Self-contained JavaScript implementation with graceful fallback
- **Maintain:** Exact same interface and callback structure for DeskThing compatibility
- **Ensure:** Zero external dependencies to avoid DeskThing build system conflicts

**Phase 2: Enhanced Detection** ✅ COMPLETE  
- **AppleScript Integration:** Real macOS Now Playing detection using system automation
- **Multi-Browser Support:** Enhanced detection for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **SoundCloud-Specific Logic:** URL-based and title pattern detection for SoundCloud
- **Polling Architecture:** 3-second intervals for music status updates

**Phase 3: Debug & Refinement** 🎯 IN PROGRESS
- **Standalone Testing:** Independent AppleScript files for debugging detection
- **Enhanced Logging:** Detailed logging for understanding detection gaps
- **Real-World Validation:** Testing with actual SoundCloud playback

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)
```
SoundCloud/Chrome Media Session
    ↓ [macOS Now Playing API / Window Title Detection]
AppleScript Polling (every 3 seconds)
    ↓ [Pattern matching and URL detection]
NowPlayingWrapper JavaScript Implementation
    ↓ [Event conversion to DeskThing format]
DeskThing Track Format
    ↓ [Display update]
DeskThing Client Display
```

- URL-based detection for SoundCloud alongside title pattern matching
- Fallback chain: Music app → Spotify → Browser players

#### Callback Context Resolution (July 2025)
**Decision:** Closure-based callback binding instead of .bind() approach  
**Reasoning:**
- Fixed `TypeError: this.callback is not a function` errors
- Closure captures callback context at subscription time
- More reliable than dynamic binding in async polling context
- Maintains compatibility with DeskThing's callback expectations

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Closure approach that works
const capturedCallback = this.callback;
this.pollingInterval = setInterval(() => {
    // Uses capturedCallback instead of this.callback
}, 3000);
```

#### Build System Strategy
**Decision:** Self-contained fallback implementation without external dependencies  
**Reasoning:** 
- DeskThing build system doesn't properly bundle external npm packages
- External dependencies cause `Cannot find module` errors in production
- Fallback implementation proves architecture works
- Can enhance with real API integration once base is stable

**Implementation:**
- Removed external `nowplaying` dependency from package.json
- Created self-contained NowPlayingWrapper class
- Maintained exact same interface for compatibility
- Added proper logging for debugging and verification

### Performance & Compatibility
- **Node.js Compatibility:** Works with v18, v20, v22 (eliminated version locking)
- **Memory Usage:** Significantly reduced vs crashed binary loading
- **Startup Time:** Faster startup without binary loading overhead
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful error handling vs binary crashes
- **Polling Performance:** 3-second intervals balance responsiveness with resource usage

#### Versioning Strategy (July 2025 - All Versions Today)
**Decision:** Iterative versioning with specific fix identifiers  
**Evolution:**
- v0.11.2-macos-fix: Initial working fallback
- v0.11.6: Fixed callback context issues
- v0.11.7: Stable operation with closure binding
- v0.11.8: Added real AppleScript detection
- v0.11.9: Enhanced multi-browser detection

**Reasoning:**
- Users need to distinguish fixed version from broken original
- Clear version increments for tracking specific improvements
- Descriptive app name "Local Audio (macOS Fixed)" for easy identification
- Maintains compatibility with DeskThing versioning system

#### Development Workflow (July 2025)
**Decision:** Fork-based development with feature branch  
**Reasoning:**
- Clean separation from original broken codebase
- Ability to submit pull requests upstream if desired
- Proper git history for tracking changes
- Branch-based development for feature isolation

**Branch Structure:**
- Main branch: `fix/macos-nowplaying-binary-compatibility`
- Clear commit messages documenting fix process
- Preserved original code structure for compatibility

### Current Technical Challenge
**Issue:** AppleScript detection not capturing SoundCloud data despite:
- ✅ Working AppleScript logic for browser detection
- ✅ Enhanced SoundCloud-specific patterns
- ✅ URL matching for soundcloud.com
- ✅ Title pattern detection for " by " artists
- ❌ Still returns "No music currently playing detected"

**Next Decision Point:** Determine if AppleScript approach has limitations or if different detection method needed.

### Future Technology Considerations
- **macOS Distributed Notifications:** Primary API for Now Playing integration
- **Electron Native Modules:** Alternative for deeper system integration
- **Media Session Web API:** Direct integration with browser players
- **AppleScript Integration:** Current approach - needs debugging
