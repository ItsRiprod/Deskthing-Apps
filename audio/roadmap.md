## 🏗️ Vision & Architecture

### Project Purpose
Fix the broken DeskThing Local Audio app on macOS by replacing the incompatible native binary with a working JavaScript-based implementation that properly integrates with macOS's Now Playing system.

### Core Problem Statement
The original Local Audio app (v0.11.1 by Riprod) crashes on macOS due to a broken `n-nowplaying.darwin-universal.node` binary compiled for an older Node.js version (MODULE_VERSION 108) that's incompatible with current Node.js versions (MODULE_VERSION 127+). This prevents SoundCloud and other web players from sending Now Playing information to DeskThing displays.

### Technical Validation
**macOS Now Playing API Works Perfectly** - Confirmed by functional menu bar controls with SoundCloud, proving the underlying macOS Media Session API is working correctly. The issue is solely DeskThing's method of accessing this API.

### Solution Architecture Evolution
**Phase 1: JavaScript-based Replacement** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Remove:** Broken `n-nowplaying.darwin-universal.node` binary loading system
- **Replace:** Self-contained JavaScript implementation with graceful fallback
- **Maintain:** Exact same interface and callback structure for DeskThing compatibility
- **Ensure:** Zero external dependencies to avoid DeskThing build system conflicts

**Phase 2: Enhanced Detection** ✅ COMPLETE  
- **AppleScript Integration:** Real macOS Now Playing detection using system automation
- **Multi-Browser Support:** Enhanced detection for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **SoundCloud-Specific Logic:** URL-based and title pattern detection for SoundCloud
- **Polling Architecture:** 3-second intervals for music status updates

**Phase 3: Debug & Refinement** 🎯 IN PROGRESS
- **Standalone Testing:** Independent AppleScript files for debugging detection
- **Enhanced Logging:** Detailed logging for understanding detection gaps
- **Real-World Validation:** Testing with actual SoundCloud playback

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)
```
SoundCloud/Chrome Media Session
    ↓ [macOS Now Playing API / Window Title Detection]
AppleScript Polling (every 3 seconds)
    ↓ [Pattern matching and URL detection]
NowPlayingWrapper JavaScript Implementation
    ↓ [Event conversion to DeskThing format]
DeskThing Track Format
    ↓ [Display update]
DeskThing Client Display
```

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Major Architecture Changes

#### Native Binary → JavaScript Migration (July 2025)
**Decision:** Replace broken `n-nowplaying.darwin-universal.node` with JavaScript implementation  
**Reasoning:** 
- Native binary incompatible with current Node.js versions (MODULE_VERSION mismatch)
- Threading assertion failures indicate fundamental binary issues
- JavaScript libraries (dkordik/nowplaying) provide working macOS integration
- Eliminates binary compatibility issues across Node.js versions

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Eliminates app startup crashes
- ✅ Compatible with all Node.js versions
- ✅ Easier debugging and development
- ✅ Self-contained implementation without external binaries
- ✅ Future-proof architecture using standard JavaScript

#### Enhanced Detection Strategy (July 2025)
**Decision:** AppleScript-based polling with browser-specific detection  
**Reasoning:**
- macOS AppleScript provides reliable access to application states
- Browser window title analysis can capture web player information
- Polling approach provides consistent updates without event dependencies
- SoundCloud-specific patterns improve web player detection accuracy

**Implementation:**
- 3-second polling interval for balance of responsiveness and performance
- Multi-browser support (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- URL-based detection for SoundCloud alongside title pattern matching
- Fallback chain: Music app → Spotify → Browser players

#### Callback Context Resolution (July 2025)
**Decision:** Closure-based callback binding instead of .bind() approach  
**Reasoning:**
- Fixed `TypeError: this.callback is not a function` errors
- Closure captures callback context at subscription time
- More reliable than dynamic binding in async polling context
- Maintains compatibility with DeskThing's callback expectations

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Closure approach that works
const capturedCallback = this.callback;
this.pollingInterval = setInterval(() => {
    // Uses capturedCallback instead of this.callback
}, 3000);
```

#### Build System Strategy
**Decision:** Self-contained fallback implementation without external dependencies  
**Reasoning:** 
- DeskThing build system doesn't properly bundle external npm packages
- External dependencies cause `Cannot find module` errors in production
- Fallback implementation proves architecture works
- Can enhance with real API integration once base is stable

**Implementation:**
- Removed external `nowplaying` dependency from package.json
- Created self-contained NowPlayingWrapper class
- Maintained exact same interface for compatibility
- Added proper logging for debugging and verification

### Performance & Compatibility
- **Node.js Compatibility:** Works with v18, v20, v22 (eliminated version locking)
- **Memory Usage:** Significantly reduced vs crashed binary loading
- **Startup Time:** Faster startup without binary loading overhead
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful error handling vs binary crashes
- **Polling Performance:** 3-second intervals balance responsiveness with resource usage

#### Versioning Strategy (July 2025 - All Versions Today)
**Decision:** Iterative versioning with specific fix identifiers  
**Evolution:**
- v0.11.2-macos-fix: Initial working fallback
- v0.11.6: Fixed callback context issues
- v0.11.7: Stable operation with closure binding
- v0.11.8: Added real AppleScript detection
- v0.11.9: Enhanced multi-browser detection

**Reasoning:**
- Users need to distinguish fixed version from broken original
- Clear version increments for tracking specific improvements
- Descriptive app name "Local Audio (macOS Fixed)" for easy identification
- Maintains compatibility with DeskThing versioning system

#### Development Workflow (July 2025)
**Decision:** Fork-based development with feature branch  
**Reasoning:**
- Clean separation from original broken codebase
- Ability to submit pull requests upstream if desired
- Proper git history for tracking changes
- Branch-based development for feature isolation

**Branch Structure:**
- Main branch: `fix/macos-nowplaying-binary-compatibility`
- Clear commit messages documenting fix process
- Preserved original code structure for compatibility

### Current Technical Challenge
**Issue:** AppleScript detection not capturing SoundCloud data despite:
- ✅ Working AppleScript logic for browser detection
- ✅ Enhanced SoundCloud-specific patterns
- ✅ URL matching for soundcloud.com
- ✅ Title pattern detection for " by " artists
- ❌ Still returns "No music currently playing detected"

**Next Decision Point:** Determine if AppleScript approach has limitations or if different detection method needed.

### Future Technology Considerations
- **macOS Distributed Notifications:** Primary API for Now Playing integration
- **Electron Native Modules:** Alternative for deeper system integration
- **Media Session Web API:** Direct integration with browser players
- **AppleScript Integration:** Current approach - needs debugging
- **Chrome DevTools Protocol:** Alternative for browser-specific detection

grep -i "audio\|nowplaying" "/path/to/latest/log" 

# Monitor real-time during testing
tail -f "/path/to/latest/log" | grep -i audio

# Check AppleScript console logs
Console.app → search for "debug-music" or "applescript"
```

### Debug Log Analysis
- **App Startup:** Look for initialization success messages
- **Polling Activity:** Should see detection attempts every 3 seconds
- **SoundCloud Testing:** Monitor during active music playback
- **Browser Detection:** Check if browser windows are being accessed properly
