# DeskThing Audio App - Implementation Roadmap

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**When starting a new Cursor session:**
1. **Update "Current Status"** - What's completed since last session
2. **Update "Recent Progress"** - Add session notes and blockers
3. **Check off items** in "Implementation Phases" as you complete them
4. **Add to "Technical Decisions"** if you make architecture choices

**Update frequency:**
- **Current Status** - Every session
- **Recent Progress** - Every session (can have multiple sessions per day)
- **Implementation Phases** - As features complete
- **Vision & Architecture** - Rarely (major changes only)
- **Technical Decisions** - When making key choices

**Note:** Multiple sessions per day are common - just add new progress entries additively rather than replacing previous session work.

## 🎯 Current Status

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Current Phase:** 🔧 **INTEGRATION COMPLETION** - Connecting existing infrastructure  
**Status:** ⚠️ **FOUNDATION BUILT, GAPS REMAIN** - Core components exist but need integration  
**Architecture:** Solid foundation with WebSocket + Chrome Extension infrastructure, missing connections

### 🏗️ REALITY CHECK - Infrastructure vs Integration

**What We Have Built:**
- ✅ **Basic DeskThing Integration** - Audio app properly handles DeskThing events
- ✅ **Traditional Detection** - `node-nowplaying` working for basic media detection
- ✅ **Dashboard Server** - Full Express + WebSocket server with comprehensive API endpoints
- ✅ **Chrome Extension** - Complete extension with background script, content scripts, popup UI
- ✅ **WebSocket Infrastructure** - Server ready to receive real-time data on ws://localhost:8080

**What Needs Integration:**
- ❌ **WebSocket Pipeline** - Extension data not flowing to audio app properly
- ❌ **Cross-Window Control** - Extension coordination exists but not connected to audio controls
- ❌ **Enhanced Detection** - MediaSession code has AppleScript syntax errors
- ❌ **Real-time Updates** - Audio app still uses traditional polling vs WebSocket data

### 🔍 Integration Gap Analysis

#### **The Disconnect - Three Independent Systems:**
1. **Audio App** (`audio/server/`) - Works with DeskThing, uses `node-nowplaying`
2. **Dashboard Server** (`dashboard-server.js`) - Has WebSocket + full API, works independently  
3. **Chrome Extension** - Detects media, has popup controls, connects to WebSocket

**Missing Links:**
- Chrome Extension → Audio App data flow
- Cross-window control → Audio app control execution
- WebSocket real-time data → Audio app consumption

## 📊 **Current Working vs Non-Working**

### ✅ **Currently Functional (Tested)**
- **Basic Audio App** - Starts, connects to DeskThing, handles events
- **Dashboard Server** - Runs on port 8080 with full API endpoints
- **Chrome Extension** - Installed, popup works, content scripts detect MediaSession
- **Traditional Detection** - `node-nowplaying` provides basic media data
- **WebSocket Server** - Accepts connections, handles messages

### ❌ **Non-Functional (Broken/Incomplete)**
- **Extension → Audio App** - Data not flowing from extension to audio app server
- **Cross-Window Control** - Dashboard controls don't work across windows
- **Enhanced MediaSession** - AppleScript syntax errors prevent advanced detection
- **Real-time Pipeline** - Audio app doesn't receive WebSocket data as primary source
- **Position/Duration** - Enhanced metadata gathering fails due to AppleScript issues

## 🚀 **Implementation Phases - CORRECTED STATUS**

- [ ] **Connection Management** - Robust reconnection and error handling

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture Status**

### **Audio App Server Current State:**
```typescript
// ✅ WORKING: Basic DeskThing integration
const mediaStore = MediaStore.getInstance()
await mediaStore.initializeListeners()

// ⚠️ INCOMPLETE: WebSocket integration designed but not fully connected
export class DashboardNowPlaying {
  private connectWebSocket() {
    this.ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080') // Connects but integration incomplete
  }
}
```

### **Dashboard Server Current State:**
```javascript
// ✅ WORKING: Full API endpoints and WebSocket server
app.get('/api/media/detect') // ✅ Working
app.post('/api/media/control') // ✅ Working basic controls
app.post('/api/extension/control') // ✅ Endpoint exists but not used by audio app
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server }) // ✅ Working WebSocket server
```

### **Chrome Extension Current State:**
```javascript
// ✅ WORKING: Complete extension infrastructure
background.js: handleCrossWindowControl() // ✅ Cross-window coordination implemented
content.js: MediaSession monitoring + WebSocket // ✅ Detection and connection working
popup.js: Working media controls // ✅ Standalone controls functional

// ❌ MISSING: Integration with audio app server
// Extension works independently but doesn't feed audio app properly
```

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**
