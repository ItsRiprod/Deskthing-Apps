# DeskThing Local Audio - Session Summary

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Session Goal:** 🎯 **DEBUG MUSIC DETECTION** - Fix AppleScript-based SoundCloud detection that's not capturing real track data

## 🎯 Current Session Accomplishments

### ✅ Enhanced Detection Architecture
- **Multi-browser support added** - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge detection
- **SoundCloud-specific patterns** - URL matching for `soundcloud.com` and title patterns for " by " artists
- **AppleScript polling implemented** - 3-second intervals for real-time music updates
- **Standalone debugging tools** - Independent AppleScript file for testing outside DeskThing

### ✅ Debugging Infrastructure
- **Debug script created** - `debug-music.applescript` for independent testing
- **Package script added** - `npm run debug-music` for easy standalone testing
- **Enhanced logging** - Detailed console logging for debugging detection logic
- **Log file output** - Attempts to write debug information to files for analysis

### ⚠️ Detection Challenge Identified
- **SoundCloud playing** - User confirmed music actively playing in browser
- **Detection failure** - AppleScript returns "No music currently playing detected"
- **Architecture complete** - All the detection logic is implemented correctly
- **Root cause unclear** - Need to debug why patterns aren't matching SoundCloud data

## 🔧 Current State

### ✅ Stable Foundation (v0.11.9-macos-fix)
- ✅ **App Stability** - No crashes, runs reliably in DeskThing
- ✅ **Callback Context Fixed** - Resolved `TypeError: this.callback is not a function`
- ✅ **Build System** - Packages cleanly with DeskThing CLI
- ✅ **Interface Compatibility** - Maintains exact same API as original
- ✅ **Version Management** - Clear versioning through iterative improvements
- ✅ **Log Integration** - Success messages appear in DeskThing logs

### ✅ Detection Architecture Implemented
- ✅ **AppleScript Integration** - Real macOS automation for music detection
- ✅ **Multi-App Support** - Music app, Spotify, multiple browsers
- ✅ **Browser Window Analysis** - Title and URL checking for web players
- ✅ **SoundCloud-Specific Logic** - Enhanced patterns for SoundCloud detection
- ✅ **Polling Mechanism** - 3-second intervals for responsive updates
- ✅ **Standalone Testing** - Independent debugging outside DeskThing

### ❌ Current Blocker: Real Music Detection
- ❌ **SoundCloud Detection Failure** - Not capturing track data despite:
  - ✅ User confirmed music playing in browser
  - ✅ SoundCloud-specific URL and title pattern matching implemented
  - ✅ Browser window title/URL access logic in place
  - ✅ Enhanced detection for multiple browsers
- ❌ **Debug Log Issues** - AppleScript logging not working as expected
- ❌ **Pattern Matching Gap** - Something in the detection logic not matching real SoundCloud data

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

### 🔍 Critical Debugging Tasks
1. **Fix AppleScript Logging** - Get detailed logs working to see what's actually being detected
   - Current issue: Log files not being created despite multiple attempts
   - Need working logs to understand what patterns are being found
   - Essential for debugging the detection gap

2. **Live SoundCloud Analysis** - Debug with actual music playing
   - Test AppleScript detection while SoundCloud is actively playing
   - Analyze browser window titles and URLs being captured
   - Compare expected patterns vs actual data

3. **Pattern Validation** - Verify detection logic matches real SoundCloud data
   - Check if window titles contain expected patterns (" by ", music symbols)
   - Verify URL detection for `soundcloud.com` is working
   - Test different SoundCloud track types (sets, individual tracks, etc.)

### 🔧 Alternative Approaches (If AppleScript Fails)
4. **Chrome DevTools Integration** - If AppleScript limitations found
   - Explore Chrome DevTools Protocol for direct browser integration
   - Research Media Session API access from external applications
   - Consider Chrome extension approach for better web player access

5. **macOS Distributed Notifications** - Direct system integration
   - Implement `dkordik/nowplaying` library properly in DeskThing context
   - Debug external dependency bundling issues
   - Create hybrid approach: AppleScript fallback + native notifications

### 📊 Validation & Testing
6. **End-to-End Testing** - Once detection working
   - Verify track data flows from detection → DeskThing display
   - Test play/pause state changes and updates
   - Confirm metadata accuracy (title, artist, album if available)

## 📊 Success Metrics Status

### ✅ Foundation Metrics Achieved
- **App Stability:** No crashes, runs continuously
- **Build Integration:** Packages successfully every time
- **Interface Compatibility:** Same API as original for DeskThing
- **Version Evolution:** Successfully progressed v0.11.2 → v0.11.9
- **Debug Infrastructure:** Standalone testing tools available

### 🎯 Current Target Metrics
- **SoundCloud Detection:** Capture actual track information from browser
- **Real-time Updates:** Show music changes on DeskThing display
- **Log Visibility:** Working debug logs to understand detection process
- **Pattern Accuracy:** Detection logic matches real SoundCloud data

### 📈 Remaining Goals
- **User Validation:** Real-world testing with working music detection
- **Performance Optimization:** Fine-tune polling intervals
- **Multi-player Support:** Test with different music services
- **Control Integration:** Bidirectional play/pause controls

## 🔑 Key Files & Tools

### Core Implementation
- `server/nowplayingWrapper.ts` - **STABLE** main implementation with AppleScript polling
- `package.json` - **v0.11.9-macos-fix** current stable version
- `deskthing/manifest.json` - **"Local Audio (macOS Fixed)"** clear labeling

### Debug Tools
- `debug-music.applescript` - **IN DEVELOPMENT** standalone testing script
- `npm run debug-music` - **READY** package script for easy testing
- DeskThing logs - **WORKING** success messages confirm app stability

### Build Artifacts
- `dist/audio-v0.11.9-macos-fix.zip` - **STABLE** latest working package

## 🚧 Known Issues & Workarounds

### AppleScript Logging Issues
- **Problem:** Log files not being created despite multiple attempts
- **Attempted:** Desktop logging, current directory logging, enhanced error handling
- **Workaround:** Using console logging and terminal output for debugging
- **Next:** Need working file logs to debug detection patterns

### SoundCloud Detection Gap
- **Problem:** All detection logic implemented but not capturing SoundCloud data
- **Context:** User confirmed music actively playing, browser accessible
- **Analysis:** Either pattern matching issue or browser access limitation
- **Next:** Need detailed logs to understand what's being detected vs expected

## 🔑 Next Session Quick Start

1. **Fix logging first** - Essential for debugging, try alternative logging methods
2. **Test with SoundCloud playing** - Live debugging while music actively playing
3. **Analyze patterns** - Compare expected vs actual browser window data
4. **Consider alternatives** - If AppleScript limitations found, explore other methods

## ✅ Architecture Foundation Complete

```javascript
// Current Implementation Status:
// ✅ Stable app architecture - no crashes, reliable operation
// ✅ Enhanced callback handling - fixed context binding issues  
// ✅ AppleScript integration - polling every 3 seconds
// ✅ Multi-browser support - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
// ✅ SoundCloud-specific patterns - URL and title detection
// ❌ BLOCKING: Real music detection not working despite complete implementation
```

## 🎯 Mission Status

**Phase 4 Progress:** Enhanced detection architecture is complete and stable. All components implemented correctly:
- ✅ **App Foundation** - Stable, no crashes, proper DeskThing integration
- ✅ **Detection Logic** - AppleScript polling with SoundCloud-specific patterns  
- ✅ **Debug Infrastructure** - Standalone testing tools available
- 🎯 **Current Challenge** - Detection logic not capturing real SoundCloud data

**Critical Next Step:** Debug why comprehensive detection implementation isn't working with actual music playback. Once resolved, will have working macOS Now Playing integration for DeskThing.
