# DeskThing Audio App - macOS (Basic Functionality)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Status: BASIC DEVELOPMENT VERSION** - Limited detection only

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

### Basic Media Detection (SoundCloud)
- **Track Detection** - Title and artist from browser tabs
- **Source Identification** - Recognizes SoundCloud playback
- **Basic API** - `/api/media/detect` returns title/artist/source
- **Dashboard Interface** - Web UI on port 8080

### Example Working Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Circoloco Radio 390 - Enamour",
    "artist": "Circoloco",
    "source": "SoundCloud",
    "isPlaying": true
  }
}
```

## ‚ùå What's Broken/Disabled

### Enhanced Features (All Disabled)
- ‚ùå **Duration/Position** - "Temporarily disabled (quote escaping issues)"
- ‚ùå **Artwork** - Enhanced detection disabled
- ‚ùå **YouTube/Spotify** - Detection unreliable/unverified
- ‚ùå **Media Controls** - Basic play/pause unreliable, other controls broken
- ‚ùå **Real-time Updates** - Not properly implemented

### Technical Issues
- ‚ùå **AppleScript Errors** - `Expected """ but found end of script. (-2741)`
- ‚ùå **Enhanced Metadata** - JavaScript injection disabled due to quote escaping
- ‚ùå **WebNowPlaying Integration** - Python adapter crashes on startup

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation (Current State)

### What Works
- **Browser Tab Scanning** - AppleScript-based detection from macOS
- **Basic Pattern Matching** - "Track by Artist" parsing for SoundCloud
- **Express Server** - Dashboard server responds on port 8080

### What's Broken
- **Enhanced Metadata Gathering** - Quote escaping causes AppleScript failures
- **Cross-platform Detection** - Only SoundCloud working reliably
- **Port Management** - Multiple services conflict on port 8080

## üéØ Testing (from DeskThing-Apps directory)

### Basic Test (Works)
```bash
cd DeskThing-Apps
npm run debug-music
# Output: "Circoloco Radio 390 - Enamour" by "Circoloco"
```

### Dashboard (Basic Functionality)
```bash
cd DeskThing-Apps  
npm run dashboard
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
# Shows: Basic track info, enhanced features disabled
```

### WebNowPlaying (Broken)
```bash
cd DeskThing-Apps
npm run wnp-python
# Crashes: "OSError: [Errno 48] address already in use"
```

## üöß Current Limitations

### Known Issues
1. **Enhanced Features Disabled** - Quote escaping problems prevent metadata
2. **Single Platform** - Only SoundCloud detection confirmed working
3. **Control Reliability** - Media controls mostly non-functional
4. **Port Conflicts** - Multiple servers competing for same port
5. **Directory Dependency** - Must run commands from DeskThing-Apps directory

### Console Errors
```
‚è∏Ô∏è Enhanced SoundCloud detection temporarily disabled (quote escaping issues)
907:907: syntax error: Expected """ but found end of script. (-2741)
```

## üéØ Realistic Usage

### What You Can Rely On
- Basic SoundCloud track detection (title/artist)
- Dashboard server for testing detection
- Browser tab scanning on macOS

### What Not to Expect
- Duration, position, or artwork information
- Reliable media controls beyond basic detection
- Multi-platform support (YouTube, Spotify Web)
- WebNowPlaying browser extension integration

## üìÅ File Structure
```
audio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/nowplayingWrapper.ts    # Basic detection (works)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/music-debug.js         # AppleScript scanning (works)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json                   # v0.11.9-macos-fix
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status

This is a **basic development version** with limited functionality. Enhanced features need significant debugging before being usable. The audio app provides basic music detection suitable for development/testing only.

### Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. Fix AppleScript quote escaping issues
2. Resolve port conflicts for WebNowPlaying integration  
3. Test and verify multi-platform detection
4. Implement reliable media controls
5. Enable enhanced metadata features
