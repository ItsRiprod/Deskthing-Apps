# DeskThing Audio App - macOS (Limited Working State)

⚠️ **Status: PARTIALLY WORKING** - Basic detection only, many features broken

## ✅ What Actually Works

### Basic Media Detection
- **SoundCloud** - Track title and artist detection from browser tabs
- **Basic API** - `/api/media/detect` returns title/artist/source
- **Dashboard Server** - Runs on port 8080 without crashing

### Example Working Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Rinzen - Live from Silo Brooklyn (2025)",
    "artist": "Rinzen",
    "source": "SoundCloud",
    "isPlaying": true
  }
}
```

## ❌ What's Broken

### Enhanced Features (All Broken)
- ❌ **Duration/Position** - AppleScript syntax errors
- ❌ **Artwork** - Not detecting images
- ❌ **YouTube** - Detection inconsistent
- ❌ **Spotify Web** - Not properly implemented
- ❌ **Controls** - Play/pause may work, everything else unreliable

### Technical Issues
- ❌ **AppleScript Errors** - `Expected """ but found end of script` 
- ❌ **Enhanced Info** - JavaScript injection failing
- ❌ **Real-time Updates** - Basic polling works, metadata doesn't

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### What Works
- **Primary Detection** - AppleScript browser tab scanning
- **Basic Pattern Matching** - "Track by Artist" parsing for SoundCloud
- **Express Server** - API endpoints respond correctly

### What's Broken
- **JavaScript Injection** - Enhanced metadata gathering fails
- **Quote Escaping** - AppleScript syntax issues with complex scripts
- **Cross-platform** - Only basic macOS detection working

## 🎯 Testing

### Basic Test (Works)
```bash
npm run debug-music
# Should show: "Rinzen - Live from Silo Brooklyn (2025)" by "Rinzen"
```

### Dashboard (Partially Works)
```bash
npm run dashboard
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
# Shows basic info, enhanced features fail
```

## 🚧 Current Limitations

### Known Issues
- **Enhanced SoundCloud Info** - AppleScript syntax errors prevent duration/artwork
- **Control Reliability** - Only basic play/pause somewhat functional
- **Error Handling** - Poor graceful degradation when features fail
- **Multi-source** - Only SoundCloud detection is reliable

### Console Errors
```
907:907: syntax error: Expected """ but found end of script. (-2741)
⚠️ Enhanced SoundCloud info failed
```

## 🎯 Realistic Usage

### What You Can Rely On
- Basic track detection from SoundCloud browser tabs
- Title and artist information
- Dashboard API for testing detection

### What Not to Expect
- Accurate playback position or duration
- Album artwork or thumbnails  
- Reliable media controls beyond basic pause
- Consistent detection across all platforms

## 📁 File Structure

This is a **development/testing version** with basic functionality. Enhanced features need significant debugging before being production-ready.
