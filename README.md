# Deskthing Apps 

This repository contains apps developed for the DeskThing platform. If you want to make your own or are just browsing, these act as great reference points! 

Every app here is structured according to the [DeskThing template](https://github.com/itsriprod/deskthing-template).

## 🔧 **CURRENT STATUS: FOUNDATION BUILT, INTEGRATION NEEDED**

**Reality**: The **audio app has solid infrastructure but requires integration completion** to achieve full functionality.

## 🎵 **Audio App - Infrastructure Built, Integration Gaps Remain**

### ⚠️ **Current Implementation Reality**
**What's Actually Working:**
- ✅ **Basic DeskThing Integration** - Audio app connects to DeskThing platform properly
- ✅ **Traditional Media Detection** - `node-nowplaying` provides basic media detection
- ✅ **Dashboard Server** - Full Express + WebSocket server with comprehensive API endpoints
- ✅ **Chrome Extension Infrastructure** - Complete extension with cross-window coordination code
- ✅ **WebSocket Foundation** - Server ready for real-time communication

**What Needs Integration:**
- ❌ **Chrome Extension → Audio App Pipeline** - Extension data not flowing to audio app properly
- ❌ **Cross-Window Control** - Extension coordination exists but not connected to audio controls
- ❌ **Enhanced MediaSession** - AppleScript syntax errors prevent advanced detection
- ❌ **Real-time WebSocket** - Audio app still uses traditional polling instead of WebSocket data

### 🎯 **The Integration Challenge**
The audio app consists of **three working but disconnected systems**:
1. **SoundCloud App Server** (`soundcloud/server/`) - DeskThing integration working, uses traditional `node-nowplaying`
2. **Dashboard Server** (`dashboard-server.js`) - Full API + WebSocket server working independently
3. **Chrome Extension** - MediaSession detection + cross-window coordination working standalone

**Missing:** Connections between these systems to create the intended real-time, cross-window media control.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (Current Working Components)**

### **1. Audio App (Basic Functionality)**
```bash
cd audio
npm install
npm run dev
# ✅ Connects to DeskThing, provides basic media detection
```

### **2. Dashboard Server (Full API)**
```bash
node dashboard-server.js
# ✅ Runs on port 8080 with WebSocket + REST API
```

### **3. Chrome Extension (Standalone)**
1. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" 
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `chrome-extension/` folder
5. ✅ Extension popup shows media controls, connects to WebSocket

### **4. Test What Works**
```bash
# Basic media detection
curl http://localhost:8080/api/media/detect

# Dashboard server health  
curl http://localhost:8080/api/ping

# Chrome extension works independently
# Click extension icon → see media controls
```

## 📊 **Integration Status**

### **Working Independently:**
- **Audio App** - Handles DeskThing events, basic media detection via `node-nowplaying`
- **Dashboard Server** - Complete API with `/api/media/detect`, `/api/media/control`, WebSocket support
- **Chrome Extension** - MediaSession monitoring, cross-window tab discovery, WebSocket connection

### **Missing Connections:**
- **Extension → Audio App** - Chrome extension doesn't feed data to audio app server
- **Cross-Window Control** - Extension has coordination code but audio app doesn't use it
- **WebSocket Pipeline** - Audio app doesn't consume real-time WebSocket data from extension
- **Enhanced Detection** - AppleScript syntax errors prevent advanced metadata gathering

## 🔧 **Architecture Status**

### **Detection Pipeline (Current vs Intended):**
```
✅ Current Working:
Chrome Extension → Dashboard WebSocket (working)
Audio App → node-nowplaying → DeskThing (working)

❌ Missing Integration:
Chrome Extension → Dashboard → Audio App → DeskThing (incomplete)
```

### **Cross-Window Control (Current vs Intended):**
```
✅ Current: Extension has chrome.tabs.query() + sendMessage() coordination
❌ Missing: Audio app doesn't use extension control system
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Full Integration**

### **Priority 1: WebSocket Pipeline**
- **Fix `nowplayingWrapper.ts`** - Make audio app properly consume Chrome extension WebSocket data
- **Message Format Alignment** - Ensure extension sends data in format audio app expects
- **Test End-to-End** - Extension → Dashboard → Audio App → DeskThing flow

### **Priority 2: Cross-Window Control**
- **Connect Extension Control** - Make `/api/extension/control` trigger actual audio app controls
- **Multi-Window Testing** - Dashboard Window A controls media Window B via extension
- **Performance Validation** - Measure cross-window control latency

### **Priority 3: Enhanced Detection**
- **Fix AppleScript Syntax** - Resolve quote escaping errors in `media-session-detector.js`
- **Complete MediaSession** - Enable duration, position, artwork detection
- **Multi-Platform Support** - YouTube, Spotify Web, Apple Music

## 📁 **App Structure Overview**

### **📁 Audio App (Primary Focus)**
- **Core Infrastructure** - ✅ DeskThing integration, basic detection working
- **WebSocket Code** - ✅ Exists but incomplete integration

## ❌ **What Needs Completion**

### **Integration Gaps:**
- **Data Flow** - Extension detects media but doesn't feed audio app properly
- **Control Routing** - Cross-window commands exist but don't trigger audio controls
- **Real-time Updates** - Audio app uses polling instead of WebSocket data
- **Enhanced Metadata** - AppleScript syntax prevents duration, position, artwork

### **Current Limitations:**
- **Cross-Window Control** - Dashboard and media must be in same browser window
- **Basic Detection Only** - Limited to title/artist, no position or duration
- **No Real-time Updates** - Traditional polling instead of instant WebSocket updates
- **Limited Platform Support** - Enhanced detection broken for most music sites

## 📊 **Before vs After Integration (Target)**

| Component | Current State | After Integration Target |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Detection Source** | ✅ node-nowplaying | ✅ Chrome Extension MediaSession |
| **Data Updates** | ❌ Traditional polling | ✅ Real-time WebSocket streaming |
| **Cross-Window** | ❌ Same window only | ✅ Dashboard controls any window |
| **Enhanced Metadata** | ❌ Basic title/artist | ✅ Duration, position, artwork |
| **Platform Support** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ All major music sites |
| **Control Latency** | ❌ 2-4 seconds | ✅ Sub-200ms response |

## 🛠️ **Development Setup**

### **Requirements**
- **Node.js** - For audio app and dashboard server
- **Chrome Browser** - For extension and music sites
- **DeskThing Platform** - For actual hardware integration
