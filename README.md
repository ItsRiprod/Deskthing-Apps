# Deskthing Apps 

This is where all of the apps developed for the DeskThing is located! If you want to make your own or are just browsing, these act as great reference points! 

Every app here is the precompiled apps you download into DeskThing. The structure of each app is defined [here](https://github.com/itsriprod/deskthing-template)


## Making your own app

Prereqs: Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed! 

Run
```
npm create deskthing@latest
```
in the terminal and it will prompt you to make a new app!

From there, review https://github.com/ItsRiprod/Deskthing-Apps/wiki for the next steps


Once things are more finalized, I will document things more thoroughly here. However, until then, you can go to the discord [linked here](https://deskthing.app/discord) and I can help you get started!
