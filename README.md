# Deskthing Apps 

This is where all of the apps developed for the DeskThing is located! If you want to make your own or are just browsing, these act as great reference points! 

Every app here is the precompiled apps you download into DeskThing. The structure of each app is defined [here](https://github.com/itsriprod/deskthing-template)

## üéµ Featured: Audio App (Basic macOS Detection)

### Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY - Basic SoundCloud detection only
The audio app has minimal working features:
- **SoundCloud** - Basic track/artist detection from browser tabs only
- **Dashboard Server** - Runs for testing, enhanced features broken
- **API** - Basic `/api/media/detect` returns title/artist/source

### Known Issues
- ‚ùå **Enhanced Metadata** - Duration, position, artwork all broken
- ‚ùå **YouTube/Spotify** - Detection unreliable or non-functional  
- ‚ùå **Controls** - Only basic pause might work
- ‚ùå **AppleScript Errors** - JavaScript injection failing

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Test basic detection only
npm run dashboard
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
# Expect: Basic title/artist info only
```

**Current Detection Example:**
- ‚úÖ Basic: "Rinzen - Live from Silo Brooklyn (2025)" by "Rinzen" 
- ‚ùå Enhanced: Duration, artwork, controls mostly broken

See `audio/README.md` for detailed limitations.
