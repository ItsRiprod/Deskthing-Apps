# DeskThing Audio App - Implementation Roadmap

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**When starting a new Cursor session:**
1. **Update "Current Status"** - What's completed since last session
2. **Update "Recent Progress"** - Add session notes and blockers
3. **Check off items** in "Implementation Phases" as you complete them
4. **Add to "Technical Decisions"** if you make architecture choices

**Update frequency:**
- **Current Status** - Every session
- **Recent Progress** - Every session (can have multiple sessions per day)
- **Implementation Phases** - As features complete
- **Vision & Architecture** - Rarely (major changes only)
- **Technical Decisions** - When making key choices

**Note:** Multiple sessions per day are common - just add new progress entries additively rather than replacing previous session work.

## 🎯 Current Status

**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025  
**Current Phase:** 🚧 **BETA FUNCTIONAL** - Core features working, advanced features pending  
**Status:** 🚧 **BASIC INTEGRATION WORKING** - Chrome extension + WebSocket + basic controls functional  
**Architecture:** Chrome Extension + WebSocket approach **solid foundation established**

### 🚧 **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (July 2025)**

#### ✅ **Basic Integration - WORKING**
- **✅ FUNCTIONAL**: Chrome Extension → SoundCloud App WebSocket communication
- **✅ CONFIRMED**: WebSocket server on port 8081 receiving extension data
- **✅ WORKING**: Basic play/pause/next/previous commands
- **✅ TESTED**: Real-time data flow for track info and playback state

#### ✅ **Data Pipeline - FUNCTIONAL**  
- **✅ WORKING**: Extension → SoundCloud App data streaming
- **✅ CONFIRMED**: Track metadata (title, artist, album) extraction
- **✅ WORKING**: Position/duration tracking from MediaSession API
- **✅ FUNCTIONAL**: Cross-window command execution

#### ⏳ **Advanced Features - PENDING**

- **⏳ TODO**: Enhanced UI components

#### 📊 **Current Data Flow Status**
```
SoundCloud DOM → Chrome Extension → WebSocket → Dashboard Server
Title: ✅ | Artist: ✅ | Position: ✅ | Duration: ✅ | isPlaying: ✅ | Cross-window: ✅
```

### 🏗️ CORRECTED STATUS - Major Documentation Error Fixed

**Previous Documentation Said:**
- Cross-window control "designed but not implemented" ❌ **INCORRECT**
- WebSocket pipeline "incomplete integration" ❌ **INCORRECT**  
- Extension → Audio app "not connected" ❌ **PARTIALLY INCORRECT**

**Actual Reality:**
- ✅ **Cross-window control WORKING** via WebSocket (docs were wrong)
- ✅ **Real-time pipeline OPERATIONAL** with Extension → Dashboard (docs were wrong)
- ⚠️ **Only gap**: Dashboard → Audio App integration (much smaller than docs suggested)

### 🔍 Corrected Integration Gap Analysis

#### **Two Complete Integrations + One Simple Connection:**
1. **Chrome Extension ↔ Dashboard** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (bidirectional WebSocket working)
2. **Audio App ↔ DeskThing** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (DeskThing integration working)  
3. **Dashboard ↔ Audio App** - ⚠️ **SIMPLE CONNECTION** (WebSocket consumption needed)

**The Missing Link:**
- Dashboard has real-time data → Audio App needs to consume it (instead of `node-nowplaying`)

## 📊 **Current Working vs Non-Working - CORRECTED**

### ✅ **Fully Functional (Confirmed Working)**
- **Chrome Extension → Dashboard Pipeline** - Real-time position/duration streaming
- **Dashboard → Extension Control** - Cross-window control commands working

- **WebSocket Infrastructure** - Bidirectional communication established
- **Scrubbing Detection** - Manual seeking detected with position calculation
- **Smart Timing Logic** - Persistence across updates, new song detection
- **Cross-Window Control** - Dashboard Window A controls SoundCloud Window B
- **Audio App DeskThing Integration** - Basic event handling working
