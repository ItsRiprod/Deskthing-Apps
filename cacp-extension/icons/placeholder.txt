CACP Extension Icons

The following icon files are referenced in manifest.json but need to be created:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For testing, you can use any PNG images with these dimensions, or copy icons from the soundcloud-extension folder.

Simple icon creation options:
1. Copy from soundcloud-extension/icons/ (if they exist)
2. Create simple colored squares with online tools
3. Use CACP logo design with audio wave pattern

Colors: #007aff (CACP blue) with audio wave elements
